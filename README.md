# Overtime React Exercise

Thank you for applying to Overtime! For this exercise, please spend **no more than 1-2 hours** making improvements to performance, usability, and code style. If at the end of that time window you have further suggestions, please summarize them in your email response.

## Setting up

You'll need to have node and npm installed. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.

## Running the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Project Spec

This application should run in Chrome or Firefox. The user should see a short video clip, from which they can generate a watermarked image. There should be inputs for the position of the watermark, a button to create the watermark, and a checkbox that enables "live" mode that updates the watermarked image as the video plays.

If you don't have a working, if flawed, application running after `npm install` and `npm start`, please contact [Seth at Overtime](seth@itsovertime.com).

## Goals

Your PR should make improvements to the performance and usability of the application for the user, and the code readability and maintainability for future developers. Many of these decisions will be subjective, so use your best judgment and explain your reasoning in your PR.

## Submission

When you are ready to submit, please delete the `node_modules` folder, then zip this entire directory and return it to [Seth at Overtime](seth@itsovertime.com).

## Questions

If you have questions about the exercise, please contact [Seth at Overtime](seth@itsovertime.com).
